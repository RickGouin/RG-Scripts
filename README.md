Rickgouin.com Scripts for Datacenter Managment
This repository contains self contained scripts for data center management.  Most of these were posted in or were the focus of
blog posts on rickgouin.com.  

Focus is on Storage, Servers, Networking, Virtualization, and related hardware and software.  Most of the scripts are in Powershell.  Each script stands alone in that you don't require multiple scripts to do a function.  Each script here does what it says it does by itself.  

Some of these scripts will require Powershell Snap-ins that you'll need to obtain from the appropriate vendors.
